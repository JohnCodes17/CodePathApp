## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Youtube: Freedom it provides to learn and Algorithm to things I'm interested in
TikTok: Thousands of Videos at an instant and Algorithm
Messages: Able to contact and interact any time any where

An App I would like to create is a fincial literacy app. We all have questions and resources but no idea how to digest it. With all the information it can overwhelming and I want to help others learn and get an idea. I would like it to possible be of a tiktok format where thers multiple videos. However I would like the app to include ways to trade or enagge in stocks or other forms of financial literacy or at least inform you on their existence. I want there to be different icons on the bottom taking you to different options: a learning feed, action, ideas, notes, people, interaction, maybe even ways to test your knwoledge. 

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
